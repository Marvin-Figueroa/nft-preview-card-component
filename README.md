## My process

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Solution Hosted using GitHub Pages](https://marvin-figueroa.github.io/nft-preview-card-component/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned that it is not possible to use ::after or ::before pseudo elements with an img tag.
- I also learned that when an image is inside a div some extra space is added below the image causing the div to be higher than expected.

### Continued development

- BEM CSS Architecture
- Making Layouts without including unnecessary elements.
- Working with ::before and ::after pseudo elements on :hover pseudo class.
